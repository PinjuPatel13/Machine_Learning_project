## Brand Reputation Management
This project uses sentiment analysis and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze customer feedback and social media posts, helping businesses understand their online reputation. The model identifies positive, negative, or neutral sentiments in customer reviews and provides valuable insights for brand management.

- **Techniques Used**: Sentiment Analysis, NLP, Text Classification.
- **Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`.

## Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts customer churn (when customers stop using a service) for a telecom company based on various customer behaviors and features. It helps businesses identify at-risk customers and take proactive measures to retain them.

- **Techniques Used**: Classification, Logistic Regression, Random Forest.
- **Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.

## Email Spam Classifier
In this project, a machine learning model is built to classify emails as spam or not spam using text data. The project demonstrates the application of natural language processing to build an email filter.

- **Techniques Used**: Text Classification, Naive Bayes, TF-IDF.
- **Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`.

## Healthcare
This project aims to predict health outcomes such as disease diagnosis or patient risk prediction using medical datasets. The goal is to help healthcare professionals make data-driven decisions.

- **Techniques Used**: Classification, Regression.
- **Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `XGBoost`.

## Intelligent Sales Forecasting System
This project uses machine learning to forecast sales based on historical data. It helps businesses predict future sales trends and make data-driven decisions regarding inventory and marketing.

- **Techniques Used**: Time Series Forecasting, Regression, ARIMA, LSTM.
- **Libraries**: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `statsmodels`, `TensorFlow`.

## Personalized E-Learning Recommendation System
This project develops a recommendation system for personalized e-learning content based on user preferences, learning history, and behavior. The model suggests relevant courses and learning materials to users.

- **Techniques Used**: Collaborative Filtering, Matrix Factorization, Content-based Recommendation.
- **Libraries**: `surprise`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`.

## Movie Recommender System
Using the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset, this project builds a movie recommendation system based on user ratings and movie metadata, allowing users to receive personalized movie recommendations.

- **Techniques Used**: Collaborative Filtering, Content-based Filtering, Matrix Factorization.
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `surprise`.
