# **Brand Reputation Management**

## **Overview**
The **Brand Reputation Management** project uses sentiment analysis to monitor and manage the reputation of a brand. It analyzes customer sentiments from online reviews, social media posts, and forums. This helps businesses gauge customer satisfaction, identify potential issues, and track brand mentions over time.

## **Objective**
- **Sentiment Analysis for Brand Reputation Management**: Build a sentiment analysis tool to classify customer feedback (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Data Extraction**: Collect customer feedback data from platforms like Amazon reviews or social media using APIs or web scraping tools.
- **Text Processing**: Clean and process the data for sentiment classification.
- **Model Development**: Train a sentiment classifier using machine learning models.
- **Visualization**: Display sentiment trends and key insights using visualizations.

## **Features**
- **Data Extraction**: 
  - Use Amazon reviews, Twitter API, or Reddit API to collect customer feedback data.
  - Employ web scraping tools such as **BeautifulSoup** or **Scrapy** to extract relevant text data.
  
- **Text Processing**: 
  - Use libraries like **NLTK** or **SpaCy** for text tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
  - Create word embeddings using **Word2Vec** or **TF-IDF** to represent text data numerically (using **Gensim** or **scikit-learn**).

- **Model Development**: 
  - Train a sentiment classifier using models such as **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, or deep learning models like **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) with **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.
  - The classifier categorizes feedback into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiments.

- **Visualization**: 
  - Visualize sentiment analysis results and track reputation trends over time.
  - Use **Plotly** or **Tableau** to generate interactive graphs and reports.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('amazon_reviews.csv')

# Preprocess text data
df['cleaned_review'] = df['review_text'].apply(clean_text_function)  # Define cleaning function

# Convert text to numerical data using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['cleaned_review'])
y = df['sentiment_label']  # Sentiment labels: 0 = Negative, 1 = Positive

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## **Visualization Example**
Use **Plotly** or **Tableau** to visualize the sentiment trends over time. Here’s an example using **Plotly**:

```python
import plotly.express as px

# Sample data
df_sentiment = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03'],
                             'positive': [50, 60, 55],
                             'negative': [30, 20, 25],
                             'neutral': [20, 20, 20]})

              title='Sentiment Trend Over Time')

fig.show()
```

# **Customer Churn Prediction for SaaS Platforms**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict customer churn for Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms by analyzing customer usage patterns, subscription data, and feedback history. The goal is to help SaaS businesses predict which customers are likely to churn, so they can take preventive measures to retain them.

## **Objective**

- **Data Collection**: Gather data from CRM systems, user activity logs, and customer support records.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and handle missing data, encode categorical features, and normalize the data.
- **Model Development**: Train machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forests**, and **XGBoost** to predict churn.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model using metrics such as **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **ROC curve analysis**.
- **Visualization**: Use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize insights and trends, and **Streamlit** to deploy the model with an interactive dashboard.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handle missing values and preprocess categorical variables using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
  - Normalize data using **scikit-learn**'s `LabelEncoder` and `StandardScaler`.
  
- **Model Development**: 
  - Train models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest Classifier**, and **XGBoost** using **scikit-learn** and **XGBoost** libraries.

   Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PinjuPatel13/Customer_Churn_Prediction.git
   cd Customer_Churn_Prediction
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   Create a virtual environment to isolate your dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:

     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install all the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Running the Project**

### **Step 1: Load the Dataset**
Ensure that you have the **Telco_Customer_Churn.csv** or your chosen dataset ready. This dataset should contain customer details, subscription history, usage data, and churn information.

### **Step 2: Data Preprocessing**

Use **Pandas** to clean and preprocess the data:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Telco_Customer_Churn.csv')

# Handle missing values and preprocessing steps
df = df.dropna()  # Drop missing values for simplicity
df['Churn'] = df['Churn'].map({'Yes': 1, 'No': 0})  # Convert 'Yes'/'No' to 1/0 for target column

# Encode categorical variables
encoder = LabelEncoder()
df['gender'] = encoder.fit_transform(df['gender'])  # Example of encoding categorical variables

# Split data into features and target
X = df.drop('Churn', axis=1)  # Features
y = df['Churn']  # Target (Churn)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
```

### **Step 3: Train the Model**

You can use multiple classification models like **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**. Here's an example of using **Random Forest**:

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Train the Random Forest model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's accuracy
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
```

### **Step 4: Visualization**

You can use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** for visualizing important patterns and the model's performance:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Visualize the distribution of churn
sns.countplot(x='Churn', data=df)
plt.title('Churn Distribution')
plt.show()

# Feature importance visualization
feature_importances = model.feature_importances_
sns.barplot(x=X.columns, y=feature_importances)
plt.title('Feature Importance')
plt.show()
```

### **Step 5: Deploy with Streamlit**

You can deploy your model with **Streamlit**. Below is an example of how to create a simple app to predict customer churn:

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Load the trained model (if saved)
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)  # Replace with actual model loading if saved

# Create Streamlit interface
st.title('Customer Churn Prediction for SaaS Platforms')

# Input fields for prediction
age = st.number_input('Customer Age')
gender = st.selectbox('Gender', ['Male', 'Female'])

# Collect other features as required...

# Make prediction
input_data = [[age, gender]]  # Add more features as required
prediction = model.predict(input_data)

# Display the result
if prediction == 1:
    st.write('This customer is likely to churn.')
else:
    st.write('This customer is not likely to churn.')

```

To run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### **Step 6: Evaluate and Improve**
- Evaluate model performance using **Confusion Matrix** and **ROC Curve**.
- Improve the model with **hyperparameter tuning** or test other algorithms like **XGBoost** for better performance.
