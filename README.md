# **Brand Reputation Management**

## **Overview**
The **Brand Reputation Management** project uses sentiment analysis to monitor and manage the reputation of a brand. It analyzes customer sentiments from online reviews, social media posts, and forums. This helps businesses gauge customer satisfaction, identify potential issues, and track brand mentions over time.

## **Objective**
- **Sentiment Analysis for Brand Reputation Management**: Build a sentiment analysis tool to classify customer feedback (positive, neutral, negative).
- **Data Extraction**: Collect customer feedback data from platforms like Amazon reviews or social media using APIs or web scraping tools.
- **Text Processing**: Clean and process the data for sentiment classification.
- **Model Development**: Train a sentiment classifier using machine learning models.
- **Visualization**: Display sentiment trends and key insights using visualizations.

## **Features**
- **Data Extraction**: 
  - Use Amazon reviews, Twitter API, or Reddit API to collect customer feedback data.
  - Employ web scraping tools such as **BeautifulSoup** or **Scrapy** to extract relevant text data.
  
- **Text Processing**: 
  - Use libraries like **NLTK** or **SpaCy** for text tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
  - Create word embeddings using **Word2Vec** or **TF-IDF** to represent text data numerically (using **Gensim** or **scikit-learn**).

- **Model Development**: 
  - Train a sentiment classifier using models such as **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, or deep learning models like **LSTM** (Long Short-Term Memory) with **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch**.
  - The classifier categorizes feedback into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiments.

- **Visualization**: 
  - Visualize sentiment analysis results and track reputation trends over time.
  - Use **Plotly** or **Tableau** to generate interactive graphs and reports.

## **Requirements**
To run the project, ensure you have the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizing data.
- **Seaborn**: For statistical data visualization.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and preprocessing.
- **TensorFlow**: For training deep learning models (e.g., LSTM).
- **NLTK**: For text preprocessing and analysis.
- **SpaCy**: For advanced NLP tasks.
- **Gensim**: For creating word embeddings (Word2Vec).
- **Plotly**: For interactive data visualization.
- **BeautifulSoup / Scrapy**: For web scraping (if collecting data manually).
- **Requests**: For making API calls to services like Twitter or Reddit.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   First, clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PinjuPatel13/Brand_Reputation_Management.git
   cd Brand_Reputation_Management
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional, but recommended):
   Create a virtual environment to isolate the project's dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   - On **Windows**:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On **macOS/Linux**:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required libraries using `pip`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Running the Project**

1. **Data Extraction**:
   - If you're using **Amazon reviews**, download the dataset (e.g., CSV format) or use the **Amazon Product Review API**.
   - Alternatively, set up an API call to **Twitter** or **Reddit** to collect live data.

2. **Preprocess the Data**:
   - Run the script to preprocess the data (e.g., `preprocess.py`) to clean and prepare the text for sentiment analysis.

3. **Train the Sentiment Model**:
   - Run the script to train the sentiment analysis model:
     ```bash
     python sentiment_analysis.py
     ```

4. **Visualization**:
   - After running the model, use the visualization script (`visualization.py`) to display sentiment trends:
     ```bash
     python visualization.py
     ```

## **Sample Code**

Here’s an example of how you might perform sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Load dataset
df = pd.read_csv('amazon_reviews.csv')

# Preprocess text data
df['cleaned_review'] = df['review_text'].apply(clean_text_function)  # Define cleaning function

# Convert text to numerical data using TF-IDF
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['cleaned_review'])
y = df['sentiment_label']  # Sentiment labels: 0 = Negative, 1 = Positive

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train a Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate the model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

## **Visualization Example**
Use **Plotly** or **Tableau** to visualize the sentiment trends over time. Here’s an example using **Plotly**:

```python
import plotly.express as px

# Sample data
df_sentiment = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-01-02', '2023-01-03'],
                             'positive': [50, 60, 55],
                             'negative': [30, 20, 25],
                             'neutral': [20, 20, 20]})

fig = px.line(df_sentiment, x='date', y=['positive', 'negative', 'neutral'],
              title='Sentiment Trend Over Time')

fig.show()
```
