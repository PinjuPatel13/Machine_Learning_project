# **Brand Reputation Management - Sentiment Analysis**

## **Overview**
This project builds a **Sentiment Analysis** tool that helps companies monitor brand reputation by analyzing customer reviews, social media posts, or product feedback. It uses machine learning to classify customer sentiments as **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**, allowing companies to make data-driven decisions on improving their reputation.

## **Objective**
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Classify customer feedback into sentiments: positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Data Collection**: Gather reviews or social media posts via **APIs** (e.g., Twitter API) or **web scraping**.
- **Text Processing**: Preprocess text data for better accuracy using libraries like **NLTK** and **SpaCy**.
- **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model to predict the sentiment.
- **Visualization**: Display sentiment trends and brand mentions over time using visualization tools.

## **Project Files**
- **Data**: Review or social media feedback data in CSV or JSON format.
- **Code**:
  - `sentiment_analysis.py`: Script for the sentiment analysis model.
  - `Brand_Reputation_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for model development and evaluation.
  - `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries needed for the project.
  - `app.py`: Streamlit app to deploy the sentiment analysis tool.
  
## **Requirements**
This project requires **Python 3.x** and several Python libraries to run:
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **NLTK**: For text processing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For training machine learning models.
- **Streamlit**: For building the web app interface.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.

To install all the necessary libraries, run the following:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **How to Run the Project**

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the project to your local machine using this command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PinjuPatel13/Brand_Reputation_Management.git
cd Brand_Reputation_Management
```

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Install the libraries required for this project:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Collect Data
- Collect customer feedback data (e.g., product reviews or social media posts) using web scraping (e.g., **BeautifulSoup**) or APIs like **Twitter API** or **Reddit API**.
  
You can replace the `reviews.csv` file with your own dataset.

### Step 4: Preprocess Data
Clean the text data by:
- Removing unnecessary words (stop words).
- Tokenizing and normalizing the text.
  
This step is covered in the Jupyter Notebook (`Brand_Reputation_Analysis.ipynb`).

### Step 5: Train the Sentiment Analysis Model
- Use the notebook to train models like **Logistic Regression**, **SVM**, or **XGBoost** for sentiment classification.
- The model will predict customer sentiment (positive/negative/neutral).

### Step 6: Deploy the App with Streamlit
Run the following command to launch the web app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
The app will allow users to input customer reviews, and it will display whether the review sentiment is **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.

### Step 7: Visualize Sentiment Trends
Use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to plot:
- The distribution of sentiments (positive/negative/neutral).
- Most frequent words or terms used by customers.

### Step 8: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the performance of the model using metrics like:
- **Accuracy**: How well the model classifies sentiment.
- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize the true vs. predicted sentiments.

# **Customer Churn Prediction for SaaS Platforms**

## **Overview**
This project aims to predict customer churn for Software as a Service (SaaS) platforms by analyzing customer usage patterns, subscription data, and feedback history. The goal is to help SaaS businesses predict which customers are likely to churn, so they can take preventive measures to retain them.

## **Objective**
- **Customer Churn Prediction**: Predict customer churn based on historical data like subscription details, customer usage patterns, and feedback history.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and handle missing data, encode categorical features, and normalize the data.
- **Model Development**: Train machine learning models such as **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve analysis.
- **Visualization**: Use **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to visualize trends and insights. Deploy the model via **Streamlit** for interactive use.

## **Project Files**
- **Data**: `Telco_Customer_Churn.csv` (Contains customer data, churn history, subscription details, etc.)
- **Code**: 
  - `app.py`: Streamlit deployment script for the model.
  - `Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with model development, data preprocessing, and visualization.
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the project.
  
## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning model development and preprocessing.
- **XGBoost**: For building XGBoost models.
- **Matplotlib**: For creating visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: For advanced statistical visualizations.
- **Streamlit**: For creating interactive dashboards.

Install all dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Installation**

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PinjuPatel13/Customer_Churn_Prediction.git
cd Customer_Churn_Prediction
```

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)
(Optional, but recommended for isolating dependencies)

- On **Windows**:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **macOS/Linux**:
  ```bash
  python3 -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **How to Run the Project**

### Step 1: Prepare the Dataset
Make sure the dataset (`Telco_Customer_Churn.csv`) is available in the project directory. This dataset contains customer details, subscription history, usage data, and churn information.

### Step 2: Preprocess the Data
The data has been preprocessed in the code files (`Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`), including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

### Step 3: Train the Model
The code for training the model is already included in the notebook file (`Customer_Churn_Prediction.ipynb`). The models used are **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.

Run the notebook in your preferred environment (Jupyter Notebook, VSCode, or any Python IDE) to train and evaluate the models.

### Step 4: Run Streamlit App
To deploy the model with an interactive interface:

1. Run the following command to start the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. This will open the app in your browser, where you can input customer data and get churn predictions in real-time.

### Example of Streamlit Interface:
- Input customer details (e.g., age, gender, etc.)
- Get churn prediction (whether the customer is likely to churn or not).

## **Visualizations**
The notebook includes visualizations like:
- **Churn Distribution**: Visualize how many customers are likely to churn vs. not.
- **Feature Importance**: Display which features are most important for predicting churn.

## **Evaluation**
- The models are evaluated using **accuracy**, **confusion matrix**, and **ROC curve analysis**.
- You can experiment with different hyperparameters and models to improve accuracy.
